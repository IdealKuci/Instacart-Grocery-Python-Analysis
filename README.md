# Instacart-Grocery-Python-Analysis
 Instacart's Grocery Basket Insights! Explore sales patterns, customer behaviors, and strategies for better marketing and a great customer experience. 

## Objective and Overview

As an analyst at Instacart, an online grocery store, our job is to look into the sales data. Despite already having strong sales, Instacart wants to know more about its sales patterns. Our task is to analyze some of their data and come up with insights and strategies to organize customers better, following specific criteria.  The stakeholders were particularly interested in identifying different customer profiles and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly. Key questions focused on busy days and hours, customer loyalty, ordering habits based on demographics, and product popularity.

## Datasets
We have access to comprehensive datasets containing crucial customer information:

- Orders
- Orders_Products_Prior
- Products
- Customers
- Departments

## Project Structure
The basket analysis is organized into specific folders:

- Project Management: Includes the Project Brief for reference.

- Data: Separated into "Original" and "Prepared" subfolders. These contain the initial and cleaned data frames, respectively. (NOTE: The "Prepared" folder is excluded due to file size constraints.)

- Scripts: This folder houses all Python coding used throughout the analysis process.

- Analysis: Here, you'll find visualizations used to derive insights, crucial for the final report.

- Sent to Client: Includes the Final Report in Excel format along with the raw data.
